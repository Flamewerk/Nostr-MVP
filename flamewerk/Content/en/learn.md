### Why support a decentral platform ?

Imagine gaining access to the full product & sales feed from ebay, amazon, reverb,....  
Well to bad these are private companies and will only share with big corporations the information they want to give out publicly.  
Now it gets interesting regarding your own privacy and public purchasing history, while at centralised commerce you are being tracked from the vendor as a buyer you can easily chose a new identity! This creates a little bit of a conflict as we try to establish credible vendors trough the public sales history of a particular's vendor's key.

So be ware of dangers of purchasing since this is a new kind commerce platform, these stores work best when there is allready a trustbond between seller and buyer or a genuine transition or link from an established brand.
