# Moderation Police

So this is a "decentralised marketplace", as you might expect this brings in some exotic moderation problems for it to adhere to real world legal policies and since the aim is for you to be able to shop/visiting from a "normal" internet connection this marketplace has some very strikt policies. Now you might say ... thats not very decentral and you are right however to only have to state this once! Products published trough the Shop N 'Go Platform have the choice to adhere to the market place policies and be published to this marketplace,if you for any reason feel like the product you are selling should be available in your country! ALL PRODUCTS will go trough publicly open relays so you can host your own store using the global product feed or add your key to an existing marketplace for them to accept your products in their market feed. 

If one of the products does not adhere to market policy the entire store will be removed from our marketplace.
THE PRODUCTS are still available on the global product feed ( We Also Automaticly should broadcast any new Seller Key THe )
